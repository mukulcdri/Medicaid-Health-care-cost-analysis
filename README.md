# Medicaid-Healthcare-cost-analysis
Data science capstone project:

Executive Summary:

This project is to analyze healthcare cost incurred by the different states in the United States of America (USA). This project will evaluate the cost of different drugs, prescribed by doctors in last 5 years (2013-2017). This will also give us a glimpse of total cost incurred by different states, cost per capita and top five drugs prescribed. Based on last five year's data on quarterly basis, we will be able to predict future cost going to be incurred by our nation. We can also classify drugs based on their price and number of prescriptions. This will also give us an idea about the prevalence of disease or medical condition in different states of USA.
On the other side, it would be interesting to see if prescribed drugs can be substituted for the cheaper (generic) version or if drug patent is expiring soon and cost will automatically go down with time and then how much it's going to affect the overall cost.
Overall this project will give us a comprehensive view of the healthcare cost and the impact of different drugs on total cost and future prediction.

Motivation:

Being a Biomedical scientist, I have worked extensively on Breast cancer and colorectal cancer and I always wonder how healthcare cost is shooting up despite lots of discoveries and better diagnostic tools available.  With the advent in research and development, we are consistently seeing increase in life expectancy and eradication of many life threatening diseases over the time but healthcare cost is on rise My project will show how we are doing as a nation or as a state in particular. This will also shed a light on the prevalent medical conditions responsible for such a high cost of healthcare and pave a way for better management and high priority areas.

Use cases:

1. The healthcare cost incurred by different states in last five years.
2. Which are the top five drugs for the cost?
3. Is there any cheaper substitute or generic version available?
4. What we can predict for next couple of years?
5. Which are the healthier states (least healthcare cost) and vice versa.

Data Sources:

Data from medicaid.gov and healthdata.gov.
